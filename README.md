### Gameplay

![Minesweeper start screen](start-screen.png)

This is what it looks like when you first open up the app. The default setting is medium difficulty, but you can always change that using the difficulty buttons on the bottom. Click on any cell on the board to begin the game. The two numbers at the top indicate the number of mines left (shown on the top left) and the time that has passed (shown on the top right). Use the restart button if you want to restart your game with the same difficulty.

Your goal is to uncover all of the cells that aren't mines.
